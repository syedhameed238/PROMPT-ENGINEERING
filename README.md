## Aim: 
Comprehensive Report on the Fundamentals of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Experiment: 
Develop a comprehensive report for the following exercises : Explain the foundational concepts of Generative AI.Focusing on Generative AI architectures. (like transformers).Generative AI applications.Generative AI impact of scaling in LLMs.

## Algorithm:
# 1.Set up tools : Choose any one LLM interface
# 2.Design the prompts : Prepare 4 prompts that progressively apply prompt-engineering techniques:
# 3.Run the prompts on the same task.
# 4.Record outputs and write the report.

## Output
[Generative AI.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22002477/Generative.AI.pdf)

## Result
The experiment showed that prompt design greatly improves the quality of outputs from LLMs. It successfully demonstrated Generative AI concepts, architectures, applications, and scaling impacts.
